I was unable to implement every aspect of this project. I decided instead to do the parts that I do understand, hand that in
then re-do this project at the end of the semester.

Here's what I do have implented

* Version Control
* README file
* Signal Handling
* Message queues
* Logging (although the logs mean nothing)
* Makefile
* PCB definition
* clearing share memory

To run please run the following commands (in the root directory)
make
cd bin
./oss

to see version control history run (in the root directory)
cat .gitlog
